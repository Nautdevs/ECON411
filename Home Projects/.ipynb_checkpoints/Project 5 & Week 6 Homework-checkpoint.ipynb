    "Writing vanilla functions is time consuming and mentally rigorous. It makes it easier for you to reason through your high level math code when you are not worrying about the low level math functions. The program reads better when you instinctively know what the min, max, median, mode functions all do and they are part of your code. Contrast this to reading that function's logic as a block of code in the middle of your other function. It may take you a minute or two to understand that this is just a simple average function--across millions of coders that is a ton of time. I like to think of it like us writing in assembly code or C-lang when you are trying to write a simple program to get the average of some numbers. Why would anyone do that when we can save that function's logic in memory and abstract all that difficult logic away.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the logic can be optimized separately from your programs which use it. This function can be more robust, less error-prone, and optimized for that particular algorithm's best time complexity. \n",

    "On top of that, importing functions is very easy to perform and thus makes function-writing even more beneficial since distribution is easy to accomplish. It is much easier for me to know I need to open up my terminal and type 'pip install LIBRARY_OF_FUNCTIONS' then it is for me to start writing the tens of thousands of lines of pure logic required in order to implement that same program's functionality myself."
